## MyToken Smart Contract
This repository contains the source code for the MyToken smart contract. The contract is implemented in Solidity, a high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this contract is to create a custom ERC-20 token with basic functionality for token transfers and approvals.

## Contract Details
The MyToken contract has the following properties:

* Token Name: [Token Name]
* Token Symbol: [Token Symbol]
* Decimals: [Decimals]
* Total Supply: [Total Supply]
* Owner Address: [Owner Address]
The contract implements the ERC-20 token standard, which allows for smooth integration with various applications and services within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Token Features
* Token Transfer: Token holders can transfer their tokens to other addresses using the transfer function. Make sure the recipient address is valid, and the sender has a sufficient balance.

* Token Approval: Token holders can approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf using the approve function. This is a crucial step for utilizing the transferFrom function.

* Token Transfer From: Addresses with approved allowance can transfer tokens from one account to another using the transferFrom function. The sender needs to have sufficient tokens and allowance to execute this function.

* Token Minting: The contract owner can mint new tokens using the mint function. This allows for increasing the total token supply dynamically. Note that minting is only possible for the contract owner.

## Deployment
To deploy this contract, follow these steps:

Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a development environment or a platform like Remix or Truffle.
Provide the necessary constructor arguments: Token Name, Token Symbol, Decimals, and Initial Supply.
The deployer's address will become the owner of the contract and receive the initial supply of tokens.
